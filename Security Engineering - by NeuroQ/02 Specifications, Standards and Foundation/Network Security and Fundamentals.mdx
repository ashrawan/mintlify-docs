Network security defines the systematic and secured design for interconnected security controls. The evolution from traditional perimeter models to modern, distributed architectures reflects the shift to hybrid and multi-cloud environments, where **95% of organizations** operate ([Flexera 2023 State of the Cloud Report](https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud)). And the organizations with integrated physical and network security frameworks experience **89% fewer successful physical attacks** on network infrastructure and a **76% improvement in overall security incident detection** ([PSIA 2023 Convergence Report](https://www.psialliance.org/)).

## Network Security Architecture and Design

### OSI and TCP/IP Security Mapping

Security controls are strategically mapped to the [OSI](https://www.iso.org/standard/7424.html) and [TCP/IP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1122) models to ensure comprehensive protection.



* **OSI Model**:
    * **Physical Layer**: Protection of the transmission medium (e.g., electromagnetic shielding, secure cabling). **22% of data center outages** result from physical security failures ([Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/)).
    * **Data Link Layer**: Local network protection via [IEEE 802.1X port-based authentication](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.1X/7029/), [MACsec encryption](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.1AE/6029/), and [VLAN segmentation](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.1Q/6030/). Organizations deploying 802.1X experience **43% fewer unauthorized network access incidents** ([SANS Institute 2023 Network Access Control Survey](https://www.sans.org/)).
    * **Network Layer**: Routing and addressing protection through [IPsec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4301), [ACLs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1356), and secure routing protocols. IPsec deployment has grown by **156% over five years** ([IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)).
    * **Transport Layer**: End-to-end protection via [TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) and [SSH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251). TLS 1.3 adoption has reached **78% of HTTPS connections** ([Cloudflare 2023 Internet Security Report](https://blog.cloudflare.com/)).
    * **Session, Presentation, Application Layers**: Higher-level threat mitigation via application firewalls and secure application development. Application-layer attacks constitute **76% of all cyber attacks** ([Akamai State of the Internet Security Report 2023](https://www.akamai.com/state-of-the-internet-report)).
* **TCP/IP Model**:
    * **Network Interface Layer**: Combines physical and data link protections (e.g., [port security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg/sw_port_security.html), [DHCP snooping](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg/sw_dhcp_snooping.html), and [ARP inspection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg/sw_dai.html)). Organizations implementing comprehensive network interface security report **52% fewer lateral movement incidents** ([CrowdStrike 2023 Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)).

Next-generation firewalls at this layer yield **41% better threat detection rates** ([Gartner 2023 Network Security Report](https://www.gartner.com/)).
    * **Transport Layer**: Secure end-to-end communications via [TLS/SSL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446), [SSH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251). Encrypted traffic now comprises **87% of internet communications** ([Google Transparency Report 2023](https://transparencyreport.google.com/)).
    * **Application Layer**: Protection of applications and services via [web application firewalls](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Web_Application_Firewall), [API security gateways](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-an-api-gateway), and application-specific security controls. Application-layer attacks increased by **34% year-over-year** ([F5 2023 Application Protection Report](https://www.f5.com/)).
